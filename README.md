# mtcnn-kcf

This is an inference implementation of MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network) to perform Face Detection and Alignment using OpenCV's DNN module.

## OpenCV's DNN module

Since OpenCV 3.1 there is a module called DNN that provides the inference support. The module is capable of taking models & weights from various popular frameworks such as Caffe, tensorflow, darknet etc.

You can read more about it here - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Deep-Learning-in-OpenCV

Note that at present there is no support to perform training in OpenCV's DNN module and if I understood correctly there is no intention either.

### Requirements

* OpenCV 3.4+
* Boost FileSystem (1.58+)  [only required for the sample application]
* CMake 3.2+

### KCF tracker was added to improve runing time speed
### Build with flowing command
    cd mtcnn-kcf
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

### Sample command
    ./facetracker/facetracker ../data/models/
